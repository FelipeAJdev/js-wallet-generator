# Bitcoin Testnet Wallet Generator

This project is a Bitcoin wallet generator for the Testnet, using BIP32, BIP39, and the `bitcoinjs-lib` library. It creates a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet and displays the Bitcoin address, private key, and mnemonic phrase.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)
- [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#download) (to verify the address on the Testnet)

### Installing Node.js

If you don't have Node.js installed, follow the steps below to install it on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bitcoin-testnet-wallet.git
cd bitcoin-testnet-wallet
```

## Installing Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install bip32 bip39 bitcoinjs-lib
```

## Running the Project

After installing the dependencies, run the following command to generate a new Bitcoin wallet on the Testnet:

```bash
node generateWallet.js
```

You will see the output in the terminal with the Bitcoin address, private key (in WIF), and mnemonic phrase (seed).

## Verifying the Address on the Testnet Blockchain

You can use [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#download) to verify the generated address. If you already have Electrum installed, follow the steps below to configure it in Testnet mode on Ubuntu.

### Starting Electrum in Testnet Mode

1. Download and extract Electrum:

    ```bash
    tar -xvf Electrum-4.5.5.tar.gz
    ```

2. Start Electrum in Testnet mode:

    ```bash
    python3 Electrum-4.5.5/run_electrum --testnet
    ```

3. Create a new wallet or import the mnemonic phrase generated by your code.

### Checking Balance and Transactions

With the wallet loaded in Electrum, you can check the balance and transactions associated with the generated address.
